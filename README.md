# Quoffee
A Coffee queue app for offices that tells employees when their coffee is ready!

Users will be able to order coffee by type, see who's next, get push notifications when it's ready (perhaps a text) and maybe even casually chat about coffee, and their day so far!

Just clone the repo, run `npm install` and `bower install` to make sure all dependencies are up to date... Then run `ionic serve` to play around with it. Or better yet, download <a href="http://lab.ionic.io" target="_blank">Ionic Lab</a> to easily and visually edit, build, test, and deploy the app!

###Happy hacking!
